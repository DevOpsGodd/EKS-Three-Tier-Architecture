# Deploying an E-Commerce Three-Tier Application on AWS EKS

Stan's Robot Shop is a sample microservice application designed to serve as a sandbox for testing and learning containerized 
application orchestration and monitoring techniques. It encompasses various technologies to showcase a comprehensive three-tier 
architecture.

## Overview

This project involves deploying an E-commerce Three-Tier application on AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service). The application 
consists of eight services and two databases, representing a comprehensive microservices architecture for an E-commerce platform.

### Application Components

#### Services
- **Frontend Service:** AngularJS-based user interface for browsing products and placing orders.
- **Product Service:** NodeJS (Express) service responsible for managing product information.
- **Order Service:** Java (Spring Boot) service for handling order management and processing.
- **User Service:** Python (Flask) service to manage user authentication and profile information.
- **Payment Service:** Golang service for processing payment transactions securely.
- **Cart Service:** PHP (Apache) service managing user shopping carts.
- **Notification Service:** NodeJS service to handle user notifications and order updates.
- **Shipping Service:** Python (Flask) service for managing product shipping and delivery.

#### Databases
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database used for storing product catalog and user information.
- **MySQL:** Relational database for managing order data and transaction records.

### Features
- **Diverse Microservices:** The application includes microservices developed in different languages, demonstrating polyglot 
development capabilities.
- **Containerized Deployment:** Each microservice is containerized using Docker, enabling seamless deployment and scalability.
- **Service Orchestration:** Kubernetes is used to orchestrate and manage the deployment, scaling, and operation of containerized 
applications.
- **Monitoring and Tracing:** Instana components are integrated into the application to provide automatic instrumentation for 
end-to-end tracing and comprehensive visibility into time series metrics for all technologies used.

## Deployment Steps

### Prerequisites
- An AWS account with appropriate permissions.
- Installed and configured `kubectl` and `eksctl` CLI tools.
- Docker installed on the local machine for building container images.
- Cloned repository containing application source code and Kubernetes manifests.

### Deployment Process
1. **Cluster Creation:** Set up an AWS EKS cluster in your desired region using `eksctl`.
2. **Database Deployment:** Deploy MongoDB and MySQL databases on AWS RDS (Relational Database Service).
3. **Service Deployment:** Deploy each microservice using Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts provided in the repository.
4. **Ingress Configuration:** Configure an Ingress controller to expose services externally and manage incoming traffic.
5. **Monitoring and Logging:** Set up monitoring and logging solutions like Prometheus, Grafana, and Fluentd to monitor 
application performance and health.
6. **Testing and Validation:** Conduct thorough testing of the deployed application to ensure functionality and performance meet 
expectations.
7. **Scaling and Optimization:** Optimize resource utilization and scaling strategies based on application workload and usage 
patterns.
8. **Backup and Disaster Recovery:** Implement backup and disaster recovery mechanisms to safeguard data and ensure business 
continuity.

## Conclusion

Deploying an E-commerce Three-Tier application on AWS EKS demonstrates the capabilities of modern cloud-native architectures for 
scalable and resilient application deployments.

By leveraging Kubernetes and AWS services, you can achieve high availability, fault tolerance, and efficient resource utilization 
for your E-commerce platform.
